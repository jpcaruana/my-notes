# From value to values : why management has to change and how IT is inspiring the solution

Life expectancy fo companies has dropped, from 75 years to 10 years.

What is the best way to make money ? Delight customers, and not just make money to make money.

The Agile Manifesto is all about *learning*, it reveals the need of a better management.  (see leadership, stewardship)

In 2012, the 1st Stoos gathering happened:

## Why is management failing ?

* is the customer stupid ?
* the world has changed since car industry was born (1910)

We've moved from industrial economy to creative economy.
We've moved from assembly line to computers.

Globalization transfered power from industries to individual customer : "take what we make" -> "customer chooses".

## How agile management works ?
The manager as an enabler

## Better ways to make (customer visible) value
Why ?

## Stoos

## Texte de présentation

In the 21st century, there will be two kinds of organizations: those that delight their customers and those that don't. The latter will be hard pressed to survive. The management structures that were spectacularly effective in the 20th century are insufficient to meet the challenges of the 21st. To meet these challenges, new management paradigms are emerging.

This talk will examine the reasons why management is challenged and failing, the characteristics of successful management, and how the principles of Agile and Scrum can be applied beyond software development. Finally, it will introduce the Stoos Network, a nascent movement to build bridges beyond software and catalyze a lasting change in management.
