Working remotly is challenging.

- Time zone problems: try to rotate meeting times
- Information is social, discussions happen offline, so put them all online.
- Teleconferencing is not always working: be consistent with your tools.
- Embrace differences
- Advicate internally (do yourself some promotion)
- Celebrate achievements, say thank you
- Create a virtual office: coffe break in front of your screen
- Do "team get togethers" (meeting in real life)
