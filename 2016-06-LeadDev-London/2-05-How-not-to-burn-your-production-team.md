    10' talk

Issues:

- time spend inefficiently
- repetitive tasks
- working alone
- yak shaving

This will lead people to leave the company.

Ideas: 

- need to sleep: have a mandatory half a day off after a bad night
- allocate time to resolve/automate small but recurring issues
- make a knowledge matrix (people/competence) in order to just wake up the right people, and not everyone
- don't alert on all errors (causes "alert fatigue"). Alert on actionnable and on business breaking issues
- alert just the right people (for instance page duty is good at it)
- use AWS EC2 auto scaling (less human intervention)
