How to move from a culture of fear to a culture of trust ?

## Speed

Developpers want to release code a lot, deploy faster (at least once a day). Enginneers like to **ship**.

Favor autonony over coordination.

Be impatient (with tasks, not people)

## Structure

Learning/Transparency:

- helps you get context quicly
- learning from failure
- learning reviews (go to root causes). Interrogate the structure around failure. Structures are about *what* to do, not about *how* to do (otherwise this is micro managing)

## Relatedness

The feeling of belonging, of being part of a group.

Expose vulnerability (we are not in a culture of fear). YOu can fail, go beyond failure and learn. You have to feel safe within a team: admin guilt and move on (do it before it becomes shame).

Do 1 on 1s: really important. Don't do an "all business" 1 on 1. Get to know them as human beings (but you don't need to become their friends).

## Conflict

Some like it, some fear it.

Be really specific about a criticism (even without a solution)

Replace conflict with **curiosity**. Ask questions (why?) instead of saying "no".

If you have boring meeting, you don't have enough conflicts.

Empathy is a learnable skill. Feel your feels.
