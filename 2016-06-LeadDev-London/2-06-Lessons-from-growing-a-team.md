## Developping leads

It is difficult to have feedback. The danger is to be too reactive over strategic.

- What is a tech lead ? 
    + tech skills, knowledge
    + understand business
    + understand the product
    + trust from the team
    + makes their team better
- Ask on 1 on 1: "have you considered leading a team some day ?". Show that you care.
- Tell people about what you do (they have no idea what it's like), what is your productivity. Leadership is another type of problem solving.
- Create opportunities, let them practice, delegate (stand ups, sprint planning).
- Take a step back, make space.

Your measure of success: is your team getting better ?

## Expectations and performance

Between micro managing and directionless (laisser-faire)

Exercise: 

- the most impactfull thing I can do today is...
- right now I'm not great at...
- in a few months, I want to try...

## What changes for you ?

Your new role is becoming a multiplier of talents.

- trust people: give them authority, don't be too prescriptive
- become a coach: asking insightful questions. Give tools and context needed to succeed.
- make space
- take new space
- own your growth
