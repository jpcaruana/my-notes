How do we expose our teams so that people want to work for us ? transparency instead of a black box?

Create a relationship between your company and customers. Make some "emplyee evangelism": talk to events, write blog posts. Will bring new developpers to your company.

Make your users **badasses**.

How to show more with your team ?

- give them a compelling context. Start with culture first
    + be great: find something worth talking about
    + be authentic
    + be open (willing to share information and data)
- give them a compelling reason. What motivates your team ?
    + helping others
    + build confidence in communicating: become better speakers/writters
    + build personal reputation. (ex: people want to be an expert in a specific field)
    + -> understand your team's motivations
- help them keep wanting to
    + what makes them stop ? There are always fears for sharing
    + what pulls them forward ? find progression paths
    + lead by example, share the fears you have (or had)
- help them actually get better
    + perpetual expose
        * start a library
        * "talks we love" (watch a video)
        * highlight existing content
    + deliberate practice. ex:
        * lightning talks (5 minutes about anything)
        * (weekly) learning hour: teach to the team something userfull (help to practice speaking in front a of small group)
        * conference clubs: prepare for talking in a conference
        * collaboration blog post (one paragraph written by someone in the team)
        * internal blog
        * pair on blog post (what is the story you want to tell ?)

Every team can and should do this.
