How to foster excellent working environment with *minimal* process ? 

- We are making more than just software, but also **culture** and **norm**
- iteration beats rewrite
- coordination is a competitive advantage
- software engineering is a collaborative process
- solidarity matters

Qualities of high performance teams: 

- teams are the atomic unit of a company
- a good team:
    + enthousiasm and support
    + sense of togetherness
    + vulnerability (it is safe to report errors in a learning culture) -> psychological safety
- productivity is a measure of comfort
- good teams are smarter than individuals
- good teams share control (empathy)
- satisfaction is important. Without it, that's the burn out

Pratical magic:

- listen ! (eye contact)
- play a game to foster human communication, coordination and sync
- pair program
- better meetings
    1. agendas
    2. interruption free
    3. turn talking
- chit chat
- effective feedback

Good teams are like weapons. Don't suppress your humanity.
