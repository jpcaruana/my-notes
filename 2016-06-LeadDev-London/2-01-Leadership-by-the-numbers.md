Books to read (by Micheal Lopp):

- managing humans
- being geek

Your job is to **inspire** your team. Being busy is a bug, not a feature.

## Your job is information gathering, abstraction, filtering and delivery

- it is all about communication
- do 1 to 1's:
    + every week, no matter what
    + start with (choose):
        * 3 prepared points
        * a performance review
        * "my current disaster"
    + it is not about what you can find by yourself on jira or trello
- staff meetings: every week, once a week
    + if you can't fill an hour, something is wrong
    + this is investment in the future
    + it sets the tone for the week

## You are underestimating the long term **cost** of not saying the hard things

The obvious cost:

- work isn't getting done
- team morale is low
- your sanity

Non obvious costs: 

- your credibility
- impact on folks you don't know
- their sanity

-> everyone is replaceable. You have to imagine the world without this person. It will create a void that will be filled easily by someone else in a way that couldn't exist before.

-> say the hard things as soone as possible, don't let them rot.

## You probably will hire someone like you

- diversity is a no brainer. It brings other perspectives, background, ideas
- be a diversity ally

## You set the tone and cadence, all the time

- start and finish meetings on time (otherwise, this is disrespect and inefficiency)
- start acting and it will follow you

## You are horrifically bad at something

(or require more work to do so)

When doing an interview, ask/look the candidate for:

- vision: where is it going ? can you describe a feature ?
- execution:
    + strategy: the way to the vision (a picture)
    + execution: how to achieve the vision
- judgement: does he have a good judgement ? How does he apply their values in their work ?

-> delegate as much as possible, even the skills you already have. It is a great way to build a team.

Contantly reacting is bad, it show you don't have a plan, that you are not strategic.

Always be unfailingly kind.
