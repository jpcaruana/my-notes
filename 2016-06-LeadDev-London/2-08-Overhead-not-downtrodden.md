## Overhead roles

These are the roles that are important in a company but do not directly bring cash: QA, support, leadership...

(some insights about QA in the Jira team:  quality is not negociable)

## Lessons learned

1. embrace the overhead
2. broaden your view (team -> customers)
3. cost is not real value
4. leaders are overhead too
