# I just know the right person ! Networks and hiring in tech

    Yasmina Banaszczuk @lasersushi

Hiring from your own personal network is the fast and the obvious. Your network provides:

- support
- motivation
- feedback

But it comes with perception bias. Peolple tend to favor others similar to themselves. This is the **habitus**: "he reminds me of a younger myself"

The size of the network doesn't matters, its diversity does.

Company culture is not about drinks.

TD;DL: ensure diversity in your recruitment.
