The key challenge is to manage complexity: name, design, refactoring, autolated tests all need to convey the intent about software, and so does the VCS history.

A VCS system is:

- kept forever
- always up to date
- searchable (with git)

Three principles:

1. Make atomic commits
    - 1 single change by commit
    - the minimal viable commit is the smallest usefull commit
    - "A & B" needs to commits
2. Write good commit messages
    - one title line
    - a longer description
    - an explanation of why the change is being made
    - perhaps a discussion of context and/or alternatives that were considered
3. Revise development history before sharing
    - tell a useful and simple story

How to make the team adopt these practices ? Use the 3 principles yourself all the time.
