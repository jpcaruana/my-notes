You cannot fix it later, because you have users (resistance)

## The 7 rightous fights
1. Localization: make users comfy
    - don't hard code UI elements
    - no words in images
    - bake in extended character support
2. Security: make users safer
    - not cheap, not easy, but beats the alernative
    - leave room for encryption early on
    - destroy data (how does your data dies ?)
    - use existing auth services
    - stop saying "it's secure" unless you are
3. Extensibility: make code usable
    - is your API going for forever ?
    - make code reusable
4. Documentation: disater proof
    - sublte self promotion
    - good for dev onboarding (new commers)
    - production scripts, build sequence (avoid truck factor). Secretive build engineers are bad ones
    - release notes are the most important documentation for everyone. Spend time on it
5. Affordance: nudge good behaviour
    - example: the USB stick is symetrical and everyone fails at inserting them
    - use your software with regular user rights, not admin all the time
6. Acceptance: test with users
    - find people who are your users. explain them nothing (gemba)
    - if you can't hire an expert, become a student
    - software is a tool, not an end
7. Accessibility: include people
    - we are all going to need it someday
    - look at your software on a small screen
    - 8% of men are colorblind
    - screen reader links (with a descriptive title)
    - try to do tab browsing, without the mouse

## Tactics

- do what you can: bown bag lunch, pair, write unit tests
- money is the root of all business
- decision: saving money is the lever

## TD;RT

- don't build in technical debt you could have avoid
- be productively lazy
