## 1. as a developer
Job was looking at code and wanting to deliver.

What was cool :

- fast feedback (UT, monitoring...)
- problems are solved rapidly (in hours, days)
- building systems to make an impact

How to make the move from developer to lead developer ? What does it mean ?

## 2. First time as a lead dev
It was scary. As a developer, learned a lot everyday. What to do do now ? He felt like an imposter.

The path os **rocky**, with a lot of mistakes. As a tech lead, your impact is amplified.

Mistakes not to do:

- writting code all the time (because it feels safe)
- make all technical decisions (you don't have all the info). What os left for the others ?
- people is someone else's problem
- the team kown what they are doing. Your responsability is to make everyone aligned, resolve problems as a team (with concensus)

## 3. A wiser tech lead

- the world will no longer be binary
    + feedback takes days, weeks
    + don't know if it's the right action
    + -> the trap is to (re)act too rapidly
- you don't need to have all the answers: the whole team is there to back you up
    + expose your vulnerability
    + help people grow
    + "I don't know, let's ask someone who knows."
- your role is not to be liked by everyone (example, fable from Esope "the man, the boy and the donkey")
- you are not alone
    + as a dev, you were part of a team
    + as a lead dev, you are a little out of the team. They are other peolple outside the team to help you. -> build your own support network
- non tech areas are as just as important
    + less instant gratification
    + invest time in all areas
- people are complex. don't think of developers just as a collective group. Think of each person individually, what are their passions, what they do on theirs week ends... It takes tims (it's a lot of conversations). Create a feedback culture.
- you can't do everything yourself. Use the **situational leadership model**. 
    + two axis, supporting, and directing
    + 4 phases: sell, tell, participate, delegate
    + how do you progress people between these phases ?
- they are many ways to be a leader
    + coach: asking questions to let people connect the dots
    + shepherd: hep-lp people along the path
    + shaman: (story telling ability) why things are the way they are
    + champion: protect the team, to give them space
- you have a secret power: saying **no**. Focus on where there is the most value. Important things before urgent things.
- your role gives greater impact
