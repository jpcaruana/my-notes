A talk about feedback.

## 1. What is feedback ?

Formalised in Systems Theory. Feedback makes the difference between a simple system (input/output) and an dynamic system (with a feedback loop with a delay).

### An adaptive system rely on feedback

Types of feedback: 

- reinforcing feeback:
    + accelerating loop: amplifies behaviour (ex financial aid, addiction). "shiften the burden"
    + diminushing loop: suppresses behaviour (ex resource starvation). "tragedy of the commons"
- stabilizing feedback: balancing loop. Tends towards stable goal. (ex cooperation) "limits to growth"
- oscillating feedback: trashing loop (ex shower control, the beer game). "boom and burst". it needs a delay to settle

### Timing is everything

- small, frequent better than large and infrequent
- delay increases "drift":
    + reduces system responsiveness
    + limits options
    + increase processing effort

This is why "lean operation" prefer small batch size

### Why do we need feedback ?

Positive reasons:

- to improve, modify behaviour
- for help

Negative reasons:

- for recognition, validation

### Why do we offer feedback ?

Positive reasons:

- improve the system of work
- model a culture of encouraging feedback

Negative reasons:

- to control others
- to demonstrate our superior knowledge

-> Question *why* do you offer feedback

### Feedback is a system

There is no point in hearing feedback if there is no action.

Cycle of feedback: 

- offered or sought
- heard
- actionned

## 2. delivering feedback
It is a learnable skill.

- it should be about behaviour, not about you.
- SBI model (Situation Behaviour Impact)
    + Situation: don't go on a personal level. Use only specificts ("in that situation, ...")
    + Behaviour: avoid judging words. "what did you do ?"
    + Impact: impact on me. "I felt like...""

also see: the ladder of inference (use different filters when talking to different people on an inconcient level)


## 3. Structure your feedback
Build trust.

- porpoise feedback (rewards)
    + example: training dolphins for doing tricks
    + it is just kindness
    + offer positive specific regard
    + (assume that) everything else will self connect
    + the best way to interract with a new group
- sandwich feedback
    + offer positive specific regard ("I noticed that...")
    + offer a growing edge
    + end up with general positive regard (establishes safety)
- "atkins" feedback: once you have established trust
    + offer a growing edge

## 4. Receiving feedback
- Say "thank you". There is no step 2.
- think about what was positive in that feedback
- reverse engineer the SBI

## 5. Conclusion
- feedback affects the system
- be honest about your own motives
- pratice giving/recieving feedback
- always say "thank you"
