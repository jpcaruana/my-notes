# AWS Security
    Steven Schmidt, Amazon head of Security

We have to look at security from different perspectives to understand it all: CTO, CEO, PR.

Security is Amazon number one priority.

Security covers several aspects:
* physical
* network
* platforms
* people and procedures

Tom Dodustorm, NASA JPL CTO, says that "AWS is more secure taht their own datacenters"
