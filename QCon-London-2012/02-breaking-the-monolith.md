    Track: Architectures evolution

(enterprisy stuff)

## a 3 layer architecture means nothing
* UI is not always helpful
* easy: don't have to think

## System boundaries
* 1 project == 1 system ? this is the worse approach
* architecture design is different from arbitrary system boundaries

## Summary
* think about the systems that make up your system
* separate macro/micro architectures
* address UI integration and SSO
